# Hacker-News-Pipeline

The data used comes from a Hacker News (HN) API that returns JSON data of the top stories in 2014. If you're unfamiliar with Hacker News, it's a link aggregator website that users vote up stories that are interesting to the community. It is similar to Reddit, but the community only revolves around on computer science and entrepreneurship posts.
 Ran a sequence of basic natural language processing tasks using our Pipeline class. 
 
 The goal of this project is to find the top 100 keywords of Hacker News posts in 2014. Because Hacker News is the most popular technology social media site, this will give us an understanding of the most talked about tech topics in 2014!
